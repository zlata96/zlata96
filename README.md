# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

 My name is **Zlata Guseva**

 Iâ€™m an iOS developer with 1 year of experience, including 8 months of practical work on an individual project. I participated in the development of a [habit tracker app](https://github.com/FunnyPuny/iOS-App), working in a team with 5 members, we aimed to simulate the conditions of working in a commercial environment.  We carried out task planning, daily meetings to evaluate their completion and subsequent adjustments. The result of our work was a successfully published application in the [AppStore](https://apple.co/3jpuH4h).

 In recent months, Iâ€™ve been involved in a commercial project to create a Travel application. I was able to demonstrate a high level of my skills, quickly adapt to new conditions and effectively solve assigned tasks.

 My main motivation is the desire for constant development and improvement of my skills. In each new project, I see an opportunity for learning and refinement. Iâ€™m ready for new challenges and tasks, as it is a unique opportunity to become an even more competent specialist.
